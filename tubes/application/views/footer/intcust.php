            Any customs or import duties are charged once the parcel reaches its destination country.
            These charges must be paid by the recipient, as we do not take responsibility for these costs 
            and do not offer compensation to cover any of these charges. Unfortunately, we have no 
            control over these charges, and are not able to tell you what the costs may be, as customs 
            policies and import duties differ from country to country.
